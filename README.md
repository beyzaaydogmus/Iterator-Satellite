# Iterator-Satellite

## description
It’s the year 2019, and the Göktürk 3 satellite is in orbit. You work as a data analyst for the Turkish Space Agency. 
The satellite transmits data as 2D arrays (not necessarily square) of non negative integers. 
You are tasked with coding an iterator class for these data that will traverse a given 2D array spirally clockwise starting at the top left element. 

** Example: 
if the data is:
     1  2  3  4
     5  6  7  8
     9 10 11 12
    13 14 15 16
the iterator should iterate it in the order: 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10. 
Code in java this iterator recursively, and provide a main class showing it in action. Do not implement its remove method.
